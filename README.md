## Background
The Anime Dataset is a collection of data containing information about various anime series and movies. This dataset is designed to assist in analyzing trends, viewer preferences, and the popularity of anime based on various parameters. The dataset includes details such as anime titles, genres, user ratings, number of episodes, release dates, and production studios.

Anime has become a global phenomenon with a wide and diverse fan base. Through this dataset, we can explore how certain genres are popular among viewers, how ratings influence popularity, and observe anime production trends over time.

## Conclusion
From the analysis of the anime dataset, it can be concluded that anime with genres like action, adventure, and drama dominate audience preferences, reflecting a strong interest in dynamic and emotional stories. Genres such as thriller and psychological also show higher average scores, indicating an appreciation for more complex narratives.

Anime production saw a significant increase between 2014 and 2016, marking a peak in popularity. However, after 2021, there has been a decline in production, possibly due to changes in industry trends or shifting audience preferences.

Most of the anime in the dataset have finished airing, but there is still a steady flow of new content currently airing or in production. This suggests that despite the decline, the anime industry continues to strive to provide fresh content for its audience.

The relatively short average episode duration makes anime easily accessible to a wide audience, while a few major production studios play a significant role in dominating the number of productions, contributing greatly to the availability and quality of anime on the market.

Overall, despite challenges in maintaining its popularity, anime still holds great potential to continue growing through content innovation, international collaborations, and the adoption of new technologies.
